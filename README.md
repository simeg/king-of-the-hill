For your own sake you should use [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to get an isolated development environment.
 
While in the root folder, install `virtualenv` 
```bash
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
```

Create environment and then start it
```bash
$ virtualenv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

Now install all the requirements
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the development server
```bash
$ flask run
```
